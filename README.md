# Human_Emotion_Tracker

This project serves purpose as an extension to the face landmarks project. 

The basic idea is to classify human face into their corresponding emotion 

## Basic Idea 
from the face landmark, we could do detection on smile, eyelid movement etc. 

## Architecture 
- Generate face landmark from dlib. (hope not problematic otherwise need remote IDE), fix: circular import cv2

WIP.
